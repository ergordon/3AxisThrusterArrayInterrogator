# CNC Optical Channel Observer 

Welcome to the official wiki for the CNC Optical Channel Observer (COCO). COCO was developed for the Multimode Electrospray Propulsion research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign supervised by Professor Joshua Rovey.

Multi-mode Electrospray propulsion is a game-changing technology enabling small satellites with unprecedented mission flexibility. Multi-mode propulsion utilizes two or more propulsion methods on a single spacecraft with a high-thrust mode and a high-specific impulse mode. In order to achieve this task, a thruster array containing thousands of micro-channels is used. Throughout itâ€™s development, the array is exposed to a number of factors that affect the integrity of the channels. COCO was developed as a direct response to this problem. The system is a three-axis CNC microscope array interrogator capable of reliable, repeatable interrogations of the multi-mode thruster array. The system is modular to accept varying array sizes, specifically for the full-scale array and the upcoming sub-scale array.
